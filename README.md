# Insurance Portfolio Risk Analysis

**Case Study:**

Got Your Back Insurance recently used our company's Winter Storm model to determine the
expected yearly losses for 2 of their portfolios. Each portfolio contains one or more insurance policies
that cover the companyâ€™s insured properties. The analysis ran smoothly, but the client is having issues
deciphering the results and what they mean for their business. 

The client expressed that it would be helpful to see various risk metrics the data output contains. Each risk metric, also
referred to as a task below, will have its own interactive Tableau dashboard. The Tableau dashboards will be sent to the client to help them develop a deeper understanding of their
exposure. We knows that client data can often contain errors or abnormalities and has asked you to
clean the data, prepare the risk metrics via calculations, and answer a set of questions. The loss output provided by the
client can be found in Analytical_Assessment_Data.csv.

Any assumptions or changes to the data you make during this analysis should be clearly stated in the
deliverables outlined below. The definitions section will help to guide your analysis and the data
cleaning process. This assignment can be completed in the coding language of your choice.

**Tasks for the Assessment:**

1. For each state in the output file, find the total insured value (TIV) and number of risks.

2. Which 5 counties contain the largest total insured value (TIV) for construction code WD10?

3. For each portfolio, find the 10 postal codes that are the most susceptible to damage from winter
storms.

4. For each Pennsylvania postal code, find the breakdown of total insured value (TIV), risk count,
and average annual loss (AAL) by building height band.
