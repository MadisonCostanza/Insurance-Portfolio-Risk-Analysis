# Insurance Portfolio Risk Analysis

**Case Study:**

Got Your Back Insurance recently used our company's Winter Storm model to determine the
expected yearly losses for 2 of their portfolios. Each portfolio contains one or more insurance policies
that cover the companyâ€™s insured properties. The analysis ran smoothly, but the client is having issues
deciphering the results and what they mean for their business. 

The client expressed that it would be helpful to see calculations of the different risk metrics their output contains. Each calculation, also
referred to as an exhibit, will have its own table in an excel file that details how the final output was
determined. The excel will be sent to the client to help them develop a deeper understanding of their
exposure. We knows that client data can often contain errors or abnormalities and has asked you to
clean the data, prepare a set of exhibits, and answer a set of questions. The loss output provided by the
client can be found in Analytical_Assessment_Data.csv.

Any assumptions or changes to the data you make during this analysis should be clearly stated in the
deliverables outlined below. The definitions section will help to guide your analysis and the data
cleaning process. This assignment can be completed in the coding language of your choice.

**Tasks for the Assessment:**

1. For each state in the output file, find the total insured value (TIV) and number of risks.
2. Which 5 counties contain the largest total insured value (TIV) for construction code WD10?

3. For each portfolio, find the 10 postal codes that are the most susceptible to damage from winter
storms.
4. For each Pennsylvania postal code, find the breakdown of total insured value (TIV), risk count,
and average annual loss (AAL) by building height band.

**Questions to be answered are as follows:**

1. Does one of the portfolios appear to be more vulnerable to damage from winter storm? If so,
which one? Explain your reasoning and any analysis you conducted to support your conclusion.

2. Which factors appear to have the greatest influence on AAL? Explain your reasoning and any
analysis you conducted to support your conclusion.

**Deliverables**

This assignment has 2 deliverables:
1. A formatted excel workbook with:
a. A read me sheet that states any assumptions made during the analysis
b. Exhibits containing the desired outputs described in the Tasks section. The number of
sheets used to display the output exhibits is up to you.

2. File(s) containing the code written to conduct the analysis. If you did the assignment in Excel,
you should provide a workbook that contains the work you did to complete each task/question.
Each task and question should be on its own sheet.
